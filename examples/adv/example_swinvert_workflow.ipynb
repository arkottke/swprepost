    "\n",
    "In order for the data to import correctly you must provide a relative or full path to the `3_text` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For those running this as a tutorial, no changes are necessary here.\n",
    "2. For those running this locally, it is recommended you follow the same directory structure provided in the example, and therefore no changes are necessary.\n",
    "3. For those running this remotely on DesignSafe-CI, you will need to replace the `full_path` variable in the cell below with the full path to the `3_text` directory containing your results. For your convenience, an incomplete `full_path` variable is provided below and commented out. To complete the path you will need to replace `<path_here>` with the actual path. The easiest way to find the full path to your data is by using the Job Status viewer by selecting `Research Workbench>Job Status>Your Desired Job>View` which will bring you to your job results. Alternatively, you can move the `3_text` directory form the job archive into the current directory, in which no changes to `full_path` are necessary.\n",
